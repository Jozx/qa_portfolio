# QA Engineer Portfolio

## Introduction
Welcome to my QA Portfolio. I am a QA Engineer with ~7 years of experience specializing in web-based systems, primarily within consulting and government sectors. My expertise lies in ensuring software quality through rigorous manual testing, structured functionality verification, and database validation in agile, distributed environments.

This repository demonstrates my work methodology, test planning, and defect reporting standards.

## Project Context: GovTech Vendor Management Portal (Fictional)
